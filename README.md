# Hedgehog-Standard-Library
A library that can be imported directly at Hedgehog Lab

Each file contains a single function, which can be imported using ```"*import FileName"```, for example:

```js
// qr.hs at http://github.com/....../hedgehog-standard/library/qr.hs

function qr(A){
    let q=mat(); let r = mat(); class QRResult{q;r;}
    ...
    return qrResult;
}
```

You can easily import the file qr.hs and function qr(A) above in this way:
```js
*import qr
A = getMyMatrix();
print( qr(A).q );
```

Notice: Each function library must be registered at the list of ```libs``` at ```hedgehog-standard-library.json``` file. It includes a json file like:
```js
{
    "root": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hedgehog-Computing/Hedgehog-Standard-Library/main/",
    "libs" : ["magic", "qr"]
}
```
in which user can import any valid libraries LIB_NAME from the list of "libs", and Hedgehog Lab will automatically include the corresponding "hs" file by concatenating string ```"root" + LIB_NAME + ".js"```, for example:
```js
myQR = *import qr
```
is the same as 
```js
myQR = *import  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hedgehog-Computing/Hedgehog-Standard-Library/main/qr.hs
```
